My guess is that most citizens have never heard of these two public servants, which is a pity because what they do is important for the maintenance of justice and the protection of liberty and human rights.The current biometrics commissioner is Prof Paul Wiles.His roleis to keep under review the retention and use by the police of biometric material. This used to be just about DNA samples and custody images, but digital technology promises to increase his workload significantly. “It is now seven years,” observes the Commons committee, “since the 2012 high court ruled that the indefinite retention of innocent people’s custody images was unlawful and yet the practice is continuing. A system was meant to have been put in place where any custody images were kept for six years and then reviewed. Custody images of unconvicted individuals at that point should be weeded and deleted.”Continue reading...","Sun, 28 Jul 2019 06:00:08 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/28/why-we-should-be-scared-by-intrusive-menace-of-facial-recognition,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07e197f45df4c38980c0396ce1eaff9260f1b263/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48225a2ffd36efc0163498e79dc78a44

Several companies, notably Google, IBM and the California-based Rigetti, are racing to build a machine that achieves what is grandly termed “quantum supremacy”.

The idea that young men can be driven to kill byDoom,Call of DutyorFortniteis a seductive one: it’s simple, it ties in with fears that older voters harbour about digital culture and screen time, and it conveniently draws attention away from more complex societal concerns such as poverty, neglect,easy access to deadly firearmsand a violently confrontational political culture. There’s just one problem: despite years of research and hundreds of studies, there is no compelling evidence that video game violence causes real-life bloodshed. It’s a dead end.Every time these claims are made, the industry seems unwilling to analyse or engage with the reasons why games are so often implicated in violent acts. The standard response is blanket outrage and denial – games don’t cause real-world violence, they’re “apolitical” fun, so we don’t have to think about the issue, we don’t have to consider how the shooters portray or utilise military violence.

The Guardian,The Angry Birds Movie 2 review – another fun-filled flutter,"Sworn animal enemies must team up as the smartphone game adaptation catapults towards another minor triumphSony Animation’sThe Angry Birds Moviesurprised many three years ago by a) not being terrible, and b) actually being quite fun in a disposable way: the zappiest attempt at brand extension this side of The Lego Movie. The sequel tempts fate by pausing the innately funny war between birds and pigs in order to pit both factions against new predators from the neighbouring Eagle Island. Incoming director Thurop van Orman approaches this expanded universe with something of the visual ambition of Pixar’s Brad Bird and a restless, playful spirit reminiscent of theCloudy with a Chance of Meatballsfilms. The birds are no longer as irate as they once were, but the franchise appears to have levelled up.The original itched to get past its origin story and on to pixelating the game’s parrot-slinging. Film two pushes further into action territory, diversifying its carnival of candy-coloured animals – again headed by fiery avian Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) and porcine blowhard Leonard (Bill Hader) – with such newcomers as Awkwafina’s clever bird Courtney, then staging a digimated Eiger Sanction as our heroes scale the eagles’ ice fortress to face the vengeful Zeta (Leslie Jones). Three credited writers have been let off the leash to truffle for gags, as evidenced by a B-plot that pitches three fledglings into space while recovering stray eggs: essentially a replay of the Ice Ages’ squirrel-and-nut business, but with ample scene-by-scene invention to distinguish it.Continue reading...","Fri, 02 Aug 2019 10:00:19 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/02/the-angry-birds-movie-2-review,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61c47916a1566356c90ece77dd6c12186e478408/96_0_1729_1038/master/1729.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=df2503105a02b906bfd5ad100c2928e6

The Guardian,Inside the Social Network: Facebook’s Difficult Year review – thumbs down!,"As if bewitched by their level of access, the BBC ditched critical distance, rolled over and let out one giant cheer for the global techno-oligarchy. Unfriend!Facebook has a director of social good. She is called Hema and if she has a surname, we weren’t privy to it. The BBC’s Horizon team, as if bewitched at being granted unprecedented access to the social network, bowed to its ethos by captioning interviewees by first name only. But access is like sex: it’s not what you have, but what you do with it that matters.We met David, the director of harmful behaviour (tough gig, if his task is to stop it, rather than enable it), Monika, who is head of global policy management, and Vlad, Facebook’s head of artificial intelligence, though he will always be The Impaler to me.

Voilà: your embarrassingly low-tech baby is now a sophisticated analytics machine.If you can’t wait to start a more data-driven relationship with your newborn, I am afraid to say there is no word on when Lumi will launch in the UK (it arrives in the US this autumn). If you are in South Korea, however,you can grab some Huggies smart nappies; these let you know, via Bluetooth, whether your baby has urinated or defecated.

The Guardian,Facial recognition… coming to a supermarket near you,"The technology is helping to combat crimes police no longer deal with, but its use raises concerns about civil libertiesPaul Wilks runs a Budgens supermarket in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Like most retail owners, he’d had problems with shoplifting – largely carried out by a relatively small number of repeat offenders. Then a year or so ago, exasperated, he installed something calledFacewatch. It’s a facial-recognition system that watches people coming into the store; it has a database of “subjects of interest” (SOIs), and if it recognises one, it sends a discreet alert to the store manager. “If someone triggers the alert,” says Paul, “they’re approached by a member of management, and asked to leave, and most of the time they duly do.”Facial recognition, in one form or another, is in the news most weeks at the moment. Recently, a novelty phone app, FaceApp, which takes your photo and ages it to show what you’ll look like in a few decades, caused a public freakout when people realised it was a Russian company and decided it was using their faces for surveillance. (It appears to have beendoing nothing especiallyobjectionable.) More seriously, the city authority in San Francisco havebanned the useof facial-recognition technologies by the police and other government agencies; and the House of Commons science and technology committee hascalled for British policeto stop using it as well, until regulation is in place, though the then home secretary (now chancellor) Sajid Javid, said he was in favour of trials continuing.Continue reading...","Sun, 04 Aug 2019 08:00:19 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/04/facial-recognition-supermarket-facewatch-ai-artificial-intelligence-civil-liberties,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d95b7512b4caa62332b33a7836485f89b03ac18/120_869_2473_1483/master/2473.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5452ab24398d3efc6522119a8afa6db7
The Guardian,Innocence lost: What did you do before the internet?,"People born in the late 1970s are the last to have grown up without the internet. Social scientists call them the Last of the Innocents. Leah McLaren ponders a time when our attention was allowed to wanderIn moments of digital anxiety I find myself thinking of my father’s desk. Dad was a travelling furniture salesman in the 1980s, a job that served him well in the years before globalisation hobbled the Canadian manufacturing sector. He was out on the road a lot, but when he worked from home he sat in his office, a small windowless study dominated by a large teak desk. There wasn’t much on it – synthetic upholstery swatches, a mug of pens, a lamp, a phone, an ashtray. And yet every day Dad spent hours there, making notes, smoking Craven “A”s, drinking coffee and yakking affably to small-town retailers about shipments of sectional sofas and dinette sets. This is what I find so amazing. That my father – like most other professionals of his generation and generations before him – was able to earn a salary and support our family with little more than a phone and a stack of papers. Just thinking of his desk, the emptiness of it, induces in me a strange disorientation and loneliness. How did he sit there all day, I wonder, without the internet to keep him company?In this age of uncertainty, predictions have lost value, but here’s an irrefutable one: quite soon, no person on earth will remember what the world was like before the internet. There will be records, of course (stored in the intangibly limitless archive of the cloud), but the actual lived experience of what it was like to think and feel and be human before the emergence of big data will be gone. When that happens, what will be lost?Continue reading...","Sun, 04 Aug 2019 07:00:24 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/04/innocence-lost-what-did-you-do-before-the-internet,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bd0e6796f26026553661ac597942dcb826fcf97/0_19_3348_2010/master/3348.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c8e8002daae42465508e548e1904445e
