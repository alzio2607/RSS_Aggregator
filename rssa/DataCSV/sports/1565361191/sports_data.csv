Although he didn’t start playing volleyball until he was 33 and still with the Los Angeles Lakers, he sponsored his own team, was a board member of the International Volleyball Association, and was eventually named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame. “For a long time, volleyball became as big a part of my life as basketball once was,”he said. “Being able to hold my own against the best in the world, on the beach or indoors, is something I’m very proud of.” Although he played both indoors and beach volleyball, I think beach suited his personality more.I was reminded of his intense passion while watching thebeach volleyball world championshipsin Germany this summer. Forty-eight men’s teams and 48 women’s teams competed in one of the most grueling, graceful, explosive, and entertaining sports being played today. Watching the men and women spike, block, and dive around a court that is almost impossible for two people to adequately cover makes one appreciate the elite level of athleticism necessary to be competitive on an international level.

Sergio Busquets. There, that’s that done. In a world where everyone is the “New Someone”, and certain players define roles for others to follow, maybe comparisons are inevitable; but in the case of Rodrigo Hernández, the midfielder Pep Guardiola bought from Atlético Madrid this summer, and Busquets, the one he first brought on in the third division against Banyoles aged 19 more than a decade ago, it feels even more unavoidable. Perhaps, then, this signing was inevitable too. Some footballers are supposed to be in particular places.At times it seems impossible to mention Rodri without mentioning Busquets, the man whose role he is ready to inherit with Spain and under Guardiola. Some are now suggesting there could be even more to him than that. It is the role that, somehow, he always knew he would play, and if last season he didn’t, at least not exactly, that was because there were other things he wanted to master first, other qualities to develop, lessons to learn.

The Guardian,Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend,"West Ham have the talent to cause Manchester City problems on opening weekend while David de Gea has a point to proveWhile there is plenty of excitement to be drawn from Liverpool’s much-lauded front three, a good argument could be made that the two most thrilling players in Jürgen Klopp’s side are defenders. Technically, anyway. In reality, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson spent last season making a mockery of their job descriptions, zooming forward with exuberant abandon and each laying on more goals than any of the side’s so-called attackers. Meanwhile, down in the Championship, a similar operation was in progress. Norwich’s full-back duo, Jamal Lewis and Max Aarons, are under strict instructions from Daniel Farke to play with the handbrake permanently off and duly raised pulses at Carrow Road, clocking up 10 assists between them with Lewis being named the EFL young player of the season. In theory, that could spell good news for Sadio Mané and Mo Salah on Friday night: Liverpool’s chief goal threats should not be short of vacant space to exploit on their respective flanks. But either way, with so many tireless shuttlers on show, proceedings at Anfield may look less like a football match than an Olympic swimming contest.AHContinue reading...","Thu, 08 Aug 2019 23:01:32 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/09/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d8d8f5e17a98c7d1b5bf28ff932d10144c4fbb1/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82eed1b4414c3e4e628fcfd96e838c84
