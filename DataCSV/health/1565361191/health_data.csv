The Guardian,Good luck finding true love with no drama - fulfilment takes work | Oliver Burkeman,"Romance, like much else these days, comes with the promise of infinite possibility - but what we think we want isn’t always what’s bestApparently, in the dating world, there’s now an epidemic of men specifying partners and relationships with “no drama”. “I understand that people want joy, laughter and happiness in their relationships,” wrote Laura Hilgers,in a New York Times essayon the phenomenon. But the men who use such phrases, she argued, “want something that doesn’t exist: a problem-free partnership with someone who has no life experience. Are they looking for a woman who never gets angry or afraid or sad, who never worries about her family or struggles in her job?”It’s hard to say, because “drama” is so vague. That makes it a worthy successor to the now rather 70s-sounding “issues”: a label capacious enough to include people with severe personality disorders – whom you might be forgiven for wishing to avoid – but also everyone who has displayed any human emotion other than upbeat good cheer. So, by demanding “no drama”, you get to characterise your fear of difficult emotions as a simple matter of self-care. Of course you don’t want to date somebody with, you know,issues! (To be clear: if drama means emotional or physical abuse, you should definitely avoid it.) On the other hand, good luck finding a fulfilling relationship if you will only consider people with no issues.Continue reading...","Fri, 09 Aug 2019 14:00:48 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/09/love-no-drama-fulfilment-work,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e954014ee7f7db78a6a79b216e0af779ce9a755/0_19_1450_870/master/1450.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8dc966097b4a815326392da413362ca0

Whenever I look for a new place to live, there must be a surfeit of shelving or the space to create it.

The Guardian,Ayurvedic massage with sound therapy: ‘Is this how it feels to be a posh Pot Noodle?’,"It is unlike anything I have ever experienced; like being massaged from the insideSound massage? Sounds like woo-woo to me. I have been to a gong bath before, lying at the back of a sweaty studio for an hour, confused in the dark while a yogi fingered a large gong. It was a pleasant soundscape, but nothing more. I’d only gone because the event description promised participants would be wrapped in a carpet at the end, which sounded amazing; when it came to it, we were told to cover our legs with a blanket in shavasana (AKA corpse pose) if we were chilly. I had pictured someone rolling me up like a cigarillo – not something a grown man can request with any dignity. I didn’t go back.Only fair to give it another go, this time one-on-one. Michelle Cade, the founder ofMind Like Water(£90 for 90 minutes) leads various sound therapies, and today I’m experiencing it with a full-body ayurvedic massage. I clamber on to the table, ungainly, clammy, full of unrelated anxieties. Luckily, Cade is an innately soothing presence. She is also a composer ofbinaural beats, and describes brain entrainment to me; the theory by which brainwaves supposedly align with the frequency of a supplied beat. This allows you to shift your brainwaves to, say, a frequency associated with a meditative state. A nicer way of putting it than “getting mashed to a trippy jam”. I like jam. Thoughts like this wash through me and away.Continue reading...","Tue, 06 Aug 2019 07:00:15 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/06/ayurvedic-massage-with-sound-therapy-is-this-how-it-feels-to-be-a-posh-pot-noodle,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43095e6b19ac006792a8dd0f33ceedae681fc35/0_745_7425_4456/master/7425.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=484eaca724a1517b97d84a7607557940
The Guardian,‘I don’t smell!’ Meet the people who have stopped washing,"A growing number of people are eschewing soap and trusting bacteria to do the job instead – and an entire industry has sprung up to accommodate themDavid Whitlock has not showered or bathed for 15 years, yet he does not have body odour. “It was kind of strange for the first few months, but after that I stopped missing it,” he says. “If I get a specific part of my body dirty, then I’ll wash that specific part” – but never with soap. As well as germs, soap gets rid of the skin’s protective oils and alters its pH level. Although Whitlock appreciated gaining an extra 15 minutes a day from soap-dodging, his primary motivation was to encourage friendly microbes to live on him in symbiotic harmony. The bacteria get to feast on the ammonia from his sweat and he gets low-maintenance, balanced skin.Just as awareness ofthe importance of the gut microbiomehas led toa boom in probiotic and fermented foods and supplements, there is increasing interest in our skin microbiome: the trillions of microbes that protect us from pathogens and keep us healthy by making vitamins and other useful chemicals.

The Guardian,Five ways to form a good habit that sticks,"Psychological tricks such as forming a cue-behaviour link and choosing your moment make it easier to do, say, more exerciseForming a habit is trying to form a cue-behaviour link in your memory, meaning “you perform the behaviour without intentionally having to make yourself do it”, says Phillippa Lally, research associate at University College London, who studies habits. Cues can be internal or external (for example, feeling hungry or making a cup of tea) and are most effective when encountered every day, including the weekend, to minimise daily planning and willpower. Good ones include getting up, and mealtimes.Continue reading...","Sun, 04 Aug 2019 14:00:21 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/04/five-ways-form-a-good-habit-that-sticks,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aea10ccafc77c05ebbfa188e1d145754399dc916/0_188_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ea2d0d9a955764a4d43a91f6de56112

This went on for at least seven years.”If you have reached for a chalky tablet after a blow-out meal, you are not alone. So common is antacid use for heartburn and indigestion that the World Health Organizationsays more than $10bn (£8.2bn) worldwideis spent on them every year.

The Guardian,"We’re due to get married, but my fiance has lost interest in sex","There has always been a problem with our sex life but he refuses to acknowledge it. Now I fear I will end up in a sexless marriage and have started looking at other menI love my fiance. He’skind, caring, and makes me smile and laugh. We’re due to get married next yearbutone thingkeeps nagging at me: our sex life. It has never been great– to start with, he had problems with stamina– but now we have had sex only once in seven months.I’ve tried to speak to him, but he keepsbrushing it off and it only makes things worse.I look at other men and sometimes dream about them.Must I get used to a sexless life?Some people choose to enter or remain in sexless marriages for a variety of reasons. But sex is clearly important to you, so you have to make a choice. Your sexual connection with your fiance is not going to improve by itself. First, take steps to try to rekindle eroticism between you. Do this gently: he is probably unwilling to address it because he is embarrassed, ashamed or confused. Without blaming or shaming him, help him to understand how important it is to address this, and don’t take “no” for an answer. This does not mean offering him an ultimatum. Approach him with love and understanding, and reassure him that this is fixable. There are many possible reasons for his lack of interest, including his perceived issues with “stamina”. Having trouble maintaining an erection or climaxing too quickly are common problems that can be treated. Perhaps he suffers from stress, or a passion-killing mood disorder such as depression or anxiety. Or he might be taking medication that affects his sexual response. You need to work as a team to figure this out. You have put up with this situation for a long time, and I am wondering why. Some people do not believe they have a right to get their sexual needs met – and make commitments and compromises that lead to long-term misery. Is this you? You need to decide.Continue reading...","Tue, 06 Aug 2019 07:00:13 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/06/due-to-get-married-fiance-lost-interest-in-sex,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/157ace1e895b3c41c8defe098007e84151d16589/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0339ba5f32bc247c9d29718c4ba8fa50
The Guardian,I feel lonely and ashamed that I don’t have any friends,"To make friends you need to be ready to display your vulnerabilities, says Mariella FrostrupThe dilemmaI’m 40 and a full-time working mother of two teenagers. I have zero friends and few acquaintances. Spending time with my husband and children used to quell any feelings of loneliness, but that’s no longer enough. My lack of friendships is making me feel inadequate. I want a group of girlfriends I can confide in and connect with – even a single friend would mean so much. I get tearful when I see groups of friends out and about. I had a lot of good friends in school, but I let them fall by the wayside as I felt I didn’t deserve them. I didn’t have good self-esteem and for the most part, still don’t. My husband always comments on my lack of friendships, which makes me feel worse. I’m terrified of being ‘outed’ to my colleagues and relatives as friendless – and I don’t keep any social media accounts because of this fear. Please help me before I’m too old to go out and make friends.Mariella repliesFirst, congratulations are in order. You’ve negotiated your way through some of the trickiest stages of adult life without back up. To have maintained your marriage all these years without friends to offload your frustrations on; to have raised teenagers without mates to empathise, sympathise and offer counselling, and to be a full-time worker without pals to moan to over a bottle of wine means you should be feeling very proud. My instinct is that “zero friends and few acquaintances” could be more of a skewed perception of your situation than the harsh reality. It may be that the terrain you’re occupying isn’t quite as bleak as you imagine it to be, but let’s come to that a little later.Continue reading...","Sun, 04 Aug 2019 04:59:11 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/04/i-feel-lonely-ashamed-i-dont-have-friends-dilemma,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c738b1b6ea70e7bc3dd117a1a5915ee9ba49da39/386_15_3964_2378/master/3964.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d68f17b617bb619d8cafb540bde8e45c
