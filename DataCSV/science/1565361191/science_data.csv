This salt lake, bordered by Jordan, Israel and the West Bank, is nearly 10 times as salty as the oceans. In recent decades diversion of freshwater streams has made it even saltier, and since 1979 scientists have observed salt crystals “snowing” down, depositing up to 10cm on the sea floor every year. It’s the only place in the world where this happens and now scientists think they know why.During summer the Dead Sea separates into two layers: a warm super-salty layer sitting above a cooler less-salty layer. The research, published inWater Resources Research, shows that when small waves break this boundary they encourage salty fingers to penetrate into the lower layer.Warm water holds more salt than cool water, so as the fingers cool they produce salt crystals which then rain down on the sea floor.Continue reading...","Tue, 06 Aug 2019 20:30:28 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/06/terrawatch-why-salt-crystals-snow-down-on-dead-sea-floor,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a24e93c18fb72fcc644d886779b2941c01d9927a/0_170_5086_3052/master/5086.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57cadec2996e84fcd1c947917a3a03ef

The Guardian,McMindfulness by Ronald Purser; Mindfulness by Christina Feldman and Willem Kuyken – review,"Mindfulness may have become a tool of capitalism, but if it works, does it matter?In a frequently quoted passage, the American professor of medicineJon Kabat-Zinndefines mindfulness as “a way of being in a wise and purposeful relationship with one’s experience… cultivated by systematically exercising one’s capacity for paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally”. It sounds harmless enough. But San Francisco-based academic Ronald Purser thinks not. He has written a strident polemic attacking the secular mindfulness movement.Forty years ago, Kabat-Zinn set about distilling Buddhist wisdom into a framework that could address modern concerns. He originally designed a short course for people suffering from chronic physical pain. These programmes have since been extended to treat a wide range of cases including depression, addiction and workplace stress. They have been adopted in schools, businesses, criminal justice systems, in the US military, the NHS and UK parliament.

The Guardian,We can’t keep eating as we are – why isn’t the IPCC shouting this from the rooftops? | George Monbiot,"In its crucial land and climate report, the IPCC irresponsibly understates the true carbon cost of our meat and dairy habitsIt’s a tragic missed opportunity. Thenew report on landby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shies away from the big issues and fails to properly represent the science. As a result, it gives us few clues about how we might survive the century. Has it been nobbled? Was the fear of taking on the farming industry – alongside the oil and coal companies whose paid shills have attacked it so fiercely – too much to bear? At the moment, I have no idea. But what the panel has produced is pathetic.The problem is that it concentrates on just one of the two ways of counting the carbon costs of farming. The first way – the IPCC’s approach – could be described as farming’s current account. How much greenhouse gas does driving tractors, spreading fertiliser and raising livestock produce every year? According to the panel’s report, the answer is around 23% of the planet-heating gases we currently produce. But this fails miserably to capture the overall impact of food production.Continue reading...","Thu, 08 Aug 2019 16:22:17 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/08/ipcc-land-climate-report-carbon-cost-meat-dairy,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68e506f08566852d27c61f44d693d56c122cdb37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=401e02d73f7bdd4cfe4fcd36b7117cee
